<h3> The Savior’s life on earth was a life of communion with nature and with
     God. In this communion He revealed for us the secret of a life of power.
     Jesus was an earnest, constant worker. Never lived there among men another
     so weighted with responsibilities. Never another carried so heavy a burden of
     the world's sorrow and sin. Never another toiled with such self-consuming
     zeal for the good of men. Yet His was a life of health. Physically as well as
     spiritually He was represented by the sacrificial lamb, "without blemish and
     without spot." 1 Peter 1:19. In body as in soul He was an example of what
     God designed all humanity to be through obedience to His laws.
     As the people looked upon Jesus, they saw a face in which divine
     compassion was blended with conscious power. He seemed to be
     surrounded with an atmosphere of spiritual life. While His manners were
     gentle and unassuming, He impressed men with a sense of power that was
     hidden, yet could not be wholly concealed.</h3>
